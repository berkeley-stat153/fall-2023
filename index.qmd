### Supplementary resources

We will (roughly) follow some chapters of the following two books, which you can look at as supplements to the lecture notes. The first should be available to you by searching for it online through the UC Berkeley Library, and the second is freely available at the link below.

- Shumway, Stoffer, [Time Series Analysis and Its Applications](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-52452-8), 2017.
- Hyndman, Athanasopoulos, [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://otexts.com/fpp3/), 2021. 

Below are two other references on time series that may be helpful as well. The first is more advanced, and the second more elementary.

- Brockwell, David, [Introduction to Time Series and Forecasting](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-29854-2), 2016.
- Cryer, Chan, [Time Series Analysis With Applications in R](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-75959-3), 2008.
