\section{Simple exponential smoothing}

\begin{itemize}
\item Exponential smoothing is arguably the other---outside of ARIMA---most 
  popular basic framework for forecasting in time series. These two frameworks
  bear a neat connection, which you saw at the end of the last lecture on ARIMA,
  and which we'll revisit a bit later in this lecture

\item We'll begin with the simplest possible exponential smoother, called
  (unsurprisingly?) \emph{simple exponential smoothing} (SES). This constructs 
  a 1-step ahead forecast via
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ses}
  \hat{x}_{t+1 | t }= \alpha x_t + (1-\alpha) \hat{x}_{t | t-1}
  \end{equation}
  where $\alpha \in [0,1]$ is a parameter to be estimated

\item In other words, the SES forecast \eqref{eq:ses} is a weighted combination 
  of the current observation $x_t$ and the previous forecast \smash{$\hat{x}_{t
      | t-1}$} 

\item By unraveling the iteration, which is basically the same calculation that
  we did in the ARIMA lecture (but now in the opposite direction), this can also
  be written as    
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ses_exp}
  \hat{x}_{t+1 | t} = \alpha x_t + \alpha (1-\alpha) x_{t-1} + \alpha
  (1-\alpha)^2 x_{t-2} + \dots
  \end{equation}
  This explains its name, since observations $x_{t-k}$ that are $k$ steps into 
  the past are exponentially-downweighted, with weight $(1-\alpha)^k$  

\item  (Note: we are being intentionally vague here about the boundary 
  condition. In ARIMA, to develop the theory cleanly, we let time extend back to
  $-\infty$. In  exponential smoothing, we instead usually index time starting
  at $t = 0$, in which case the right-hand side in \eqref{eq:ses_exp} would end
  with $\alpha (1-\alpha)^t x_0$)

\item To make $h$-step ahead forecasts, we iterate \eqref{eq:ses}, where (as 
  usual) we replace future observations by their forecasts. This simply  
  yields \smash{$\hat{x}_{t+2 | t} = \alpha \hat{x}_{t+1 | t} + (1-\alpha)
    \hat{x}_{t+1 | t} = \hat{x}_{t+1 | t}$}, and in general, 
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ses_h}
  \hat{x}_{t+h | t} = \alpha x_t + (1-\alpha) \hat{x}_{t | t-1}
  \end{equation}
  for all horizons $h \geq 1$. That is, SES generates \emph{flat} forecast
  trajectories. We'll see how to extend this to accomodate a trend, shortly  

\item While SES smoothing is already very intuitive, we can motivate it in
  different way, as follows. The \emph{naive flatline forecaster} produces
  forecasts via
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:flatline_h}
  \hat{x}_{t+h | t} = x_t 
  \end{equation}
  i.e., it just propogates the last observation forward. Meanwhile, the
  \emph{naive average forecaster} produces forecasts via
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:average_h}
  \hat{x}_{t+h | t} = \frac{1}{t} \sum_{i=1}^t x_i
  \end{equation}
  Often we want something in between these two extremes, and that something is  
  given to us by exponential smoothing, recalling the form in \eqref{eq:ses_exp} 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Component form}

\begin{itemize}
\item For the developments that follow, it is helpful to rewrite the SES forecast
  \eqref{eq:ses_h} in what is known as \emph{component form}

\item Specifically, we think of a ``hidden'' level $\ell_t$ that we are tracking
  over time, that base our forecasts on:
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ses_comp}
  \begin{aligned}
  \hat{x}_{t+h | t} &= \ell_t \\
  \ell_t &= \alpha x_t + (1-\alpha) \ell_{t-1}
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}

\item The representation in \eqref{eq:ses_comp} may appear as kind of a trivial
  rewriting of \eqref{eq:ses_h}, where we replace \smash{$\hat{x}_{t+1 | t}$}
  by $\ell_t$, and \smash{$\hat{x}_{t | t-1}$} by $\ell_{t-1}$. Nonetheless, it
  serve as a useful jumping off point to extend the model in the next section    

\item Before moving on, we give a brief example of SES from HA, to forecast
  internet useage per minute. The data and SES forecast are shown in Figure
  \ref{fig:internet}, top row. In order to carry out the forecast, we have to
  estimate the smoothing parameter $\alpha$ in \eqref{eq:ses_comp}. This is
  typically done by maximum likelihood (but where does the probabilistic model
  come from? more later ...), and is what is implemented as the default in the 
  \verb|ETS()| function in the \verb|fable| package  

\begin{figure}[p]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{fig/internet-1.pdf}
\caption{Forecasts on internet useage data (from HA) at 10-steps ahead, from
  three different exponential smoothing models: simple exponential smoothing
  (top), Holt's linear trend (middle), and damped linear trend (bottom).}  
\label{fig:internet}
\end{figure}

\item The forecast from SES is not very impressive, and honestly, in general,
  SES should probably only be viewed as a small step up from the naive
  forecasters \eqref{eq:flatline_h}, \eqref{eq:average_h} 

\item The forecast trajectory from SES is flat, by construction (as previously
  noted). Next we'll see how to extend the method to accommodate a linear trend  
\end{itemize}

\section{Trend extensions}

\begin{itemize}
\item An extension of the SES forecaster in \eqref{eq:ses_comp} is \emph{Holt's
    linear trend} method. This changes both the forecast equation (first line)
  and the level equation (second line) to accomodate an estimate of the slope
  $b_t$ of the series at time $t$. We add a trend equation to evolve the slope
  component  

\item Precisely, Holt's linear trend method in component form (which we will
  stick to henceforth) is:
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:holt}
  \begin{aligned}
  \hat{x}_{t+h | t} &= \ell_t + b_t h \\
  \ell_t &= \alpha x_t + (1-\alpha) (\ell_{t-1} + b_{t-1}) \\
  b_t &= \beta (\ell_t - \ell_{t-1}) + (1-\beta) b_{t-1} 
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  Now $\beta$ is an additional parameter to be estimated, where both $\alpha,
  \beta \in [0,1]$ 

\item As before, the level equation updates $\ell_t$ as an $\alpha$-weighted
  combination of the current observation $x_t$ and the previous 1-step ahead
  forecast \smash{$\hat{x}_{t | t-1} = \ell_{t-1} + b_{t-1}$} 

\item The trend equation updates $b_t$ as a $\beta$-weighted combination of the
  current trend $\ell_t - \ell_{t-1}$ and the previous trend $b_{t-1}$

\item Critically, the forecast trajectory from Holt's linear trend method is no
  longer flat but (as the name suggests, and as is apparent from
  \eqref{eq:holt}) a linear function, with slope $b_t$

\item The middle row of Figure \ref{fig:internet} shows the forecast from Holt's
  linear trend method on the internet useage today. To be clear, now both
  $\alpha,\beta$ have been estimated from the data. We can see that it predicts
  a downward trajectory, since $b_t$ at the last time $t$ appears to be
  negative. However, its prediction intervals are very wide, suggesting that the 
  model is highly uncertain of trend directionality  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Damped trends}

\begin{itemize}
\item Linear trend forecasts at long horizons can be somewhat erratic; we've 
  already seen that the forecast variance is quite high in the example in Figure
  \ref{fig:internet} (as evidenced by the wide prediction intervals) and this
  wasn't even a super long horizon ...

\item As a kind of regularization, we can \emph{damp} the forecasts from
  Holt's linear trend method. This is often called \emph{damped Holt's} or the
  \emph{damped linear trend} method 

\item In addition to $\alpha,\beta \in [0,1]$ as in \eqref{eq:holt}, we
  introduce a third parameter $\phi \in [0,1]$, to damp the forecast
  trajectory: 
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:damped}
  \begin{aligned}
  \hat{x}_{t+h | t} &= \ell_t + b_t (\phi + \phi^2 + \cdots + \phi^h) \\ 
  \ell_t &= \alpha x_t + (1-\alpha) (\ell_{t-1} + b_{t-1} \phi) \\
  b_t &= \beta (\ell_t - \ell_{t-1}) + (1-\beta) b_{t-1} \phi
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  Note that when $\phi = 1$, this reduces to Holt's linear trend method in
  \eqref{eq:holt} 

\item The interpretation in the damped method \eqref{eq:damped} is mostly the
  same as in Holt's method \eqref{eq:holt}, but you can think of the
  modification like this: the contribution of a given slope to a forecast in the
  future diminishes at each step into the future, by a multiplicative factor of
  $\phi$   

\item As $h \to \infty$, the forecasts from the damped linear trend method
  approach a particular constant (finite) level, namely
  \[
  \hat{x}_{t+h | t} \to \ell_t + b_t \sum_{j=1}^\infty \phi^j = \ell_t + b_t
  \frac{\phi}{1-\phi} 
  \]
  For example, when $\phi = 0.9$, this limit is $\ell_t + 9 b_t$

\item HA say that a practical range for $\phi$ is usually 0.8 to 0.98; when
  $\phi$ is below 0.8, the damping is too strong (and short-term forecasts are
  not ``trended'' enough); when $\phi$ is above 0.98, it is too weak (and you
  cannot distinguish the forecasts from Holt's linear trend method for
  reasonably horizons). In fact, the \verb|ETS()| function limits the range of
  $\phi$ to be $[0.8, 0.98]$, by default

\item The bottom row of Figure \ref{fig:internet} shows the forecasts from the
  damped linear trend method on the internet useage data. To be clear, all of 
  $\alpha,\beta,\phi$ are estimated from the data. We can see a weak downward
  trend, that is quickly attenuated. The prediction intervals are also much 
  narrower. Inspection of the fitted model (see the R notebook) shows that we
  the damping coeffcient estimate is \smash{$\hat\phi = 0.81$}, so it has
  quite a pronounced effect here
\end{itemize}

\section{Seasonality extensions}

\begin{itemize}
\item To account for seasonality, on top of trend, we can use what is called the   
  \emph{Holt-Winters} method. This changes the forecast and level equations in
  \eqref{eq:holt} in order to adjust for a seasonal effect, but the trend
  equation stays the same. We add a seasonality equation to evolve the seasonal
  component    

\item We assume a known seasonal period $m$. That is, observations occurring
  every $m$ time points share a common (but unknown) seasonal effect. The
  Holt-Winters method is then:  
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:holt_winters}
  \begin{aligned}
  \hat{x}_{t+h | t} &= \ell_t + b_t h + s_{t+h-mk} \\  
  \ell_t &= \alpha (x_t - s_{t-m}) + (1-\alpha) (\ell_{t-1} + b_{t-1}) \\ 
  b_t &= \beta (\ell_t - \ell_{t-1}) + (1-\beta) b_{t-1} \\
  s_t &= \gamma (x_t - \ell_{t-1} - b_{t-1}) + (1-\gamma) s_{t-m} 
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  The parameters of the model are $\alpha, \beta \in [0,1]$ and $\gamma \in [0,
  1-\alpha]$ 

\item In the forecast equation (first line), we define $k \geq 0$ to be the
  integer such that $t+h-mk \in [t-m, t]$: the seasonal component we are using
  to adjust the forecast should be the latest one (whatever was available in the
  last period). This is equivalent to seeking $mk \in [h, h+m]$. You can check
  that this is accomplished by setting \smash{$k = \lceil h/m \rceil$} 

\item The interpretation of Holt-Winters \eqref{eq:holt_winters} is similar to 
  Holt's method \eqref{eq:holt}, except that we \emph{seasonally-adjust} the 
  observations in the level and trend equations. The seasonal equation updates
  $s_t$ as a $\gamma$-weighted combination of $x_t - \ell_{t-1} -  b_{t-1}$ and
  the last relevant seasonal component $s_{t-m}$ 

\item We can view $x_t - \ell_{t-1} -  b_{t-1}$ as the result of solving for $s^*$
  in the equation:    
  \[
  x_t = \ell_{t-1} + b_{t-1} + s^*
  \]
  This is like the 1-step ahead forecast equation a time $t-1$, but where we
  replace the forecast \smash{$\hat{x}_{t |  t-1}$} by the observation $x_t$ 

\item Note: we can also introduce damping into \eqref{eq:holt_winters}, which
  is just as in \eqref{eq:damped}, but do not write this out for brevity

\item Figure \ref{fig:holiday} shows an example of Holt-Winters in action, on 
  Australian holiday travel data from HA. Its ability to pick up (and evolve!)
  trend and seasonality appears impressive

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.825\textwidth]{fig/holiday-1.pdf}
\caption{Forecasts on Australian holiday travel data (from HA) at 12-steps
  ahead, from the Holt-Winters method.} 
\label{fig:holiday}
\end{figure}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multiplicative seasonality}

\begin{itemize}
\item The seasonal effect in the Holt-Winters method \eqref{eq:holt_winters} is
  \emph{additive}. If we look at the forecast equation, in the first line, then
  we see that the seasonal component is being added to the level and trend  
  components in order to produce the forecast 

\item A version of Holt-Winters with \emph{multiplicative seasonality} is also 
  possible: 
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:holt_winters_mult}
  \begin{aligned}
  \hat{x}_{t+h | t} &= (\ell_t + b_t h) s_{t+h-mk} \\   
  \ell_t &= \alpha \frac{x_t}{s_{t-m}} + (1-\alpha) (\ell_{t-1} + b_{t-1}) \\ 
  b_t &= \beta (\ell_t - \ell_{t-1}) + (1-\beta) b_{t-1} \\
  s_t &= \gamma \frac{x_t}{\ell_{t-1} - b_{t-1}} + (1-\gamma) s_{t-m} 
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  The parameters are again $\alpha, \beta \in [0,1]$ and $\gamma \in [0,
  1-\alpha]$  

\item The equations in \eqref{eq:holt_winters_mult} are motivated and
  interpreted just as in \eqref{eq:holt_winters}, except that the contribution 
  of the seasonal component is multiplicative. We can see this in the forecast
  equation, in the first line: we take the non-seasonal forecast (level and
  trend) and multiply it by the seasonal component  

\item We can view $x_t / (\ell_{t-1} +  b_{t-1})$, in the seasonal equation, as
  the result of solving for $s^*$ in the equation: 
  \[
  x_t = (\ell_{t-1} + b_{t-1}) s^*
  \]
  This is again like the 1-step ahead forecast equation a time $t-1$, but where
  we replace the forecast \smash{$\hat{x}_{t | t-1}$} by the observation $x_t$

\item In practice, the additive and multiplicative seasonal models can sometimes
  result in fairly similar component estimates---this happens with the holiday
  travel data, for example (the next subsection gives evidence of this). But in
  other problems they can result in genuine differences, so it is worth thinking
  about whether the seasonal effect in the problem at hand could
  \emph{plausibly} be multiplicative, and if so, worth trying out and evaluating
  this formulation as well 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Time series decomposition}

\begin{itemize}
\item We've talked about decompositions of time series at various points in the
  past, and touched on multiple approaches for fitting them

\item The Holt-Winters method, either in additive or multiplicative form, is not
  just a forecaster but also provides us with a decomposition of the given time
  series by extracting the fitted level $\ell_t$, trend $b_t$, and seasonal
  $s_t$ sequences  

\item There is a bit of an unfortunate clash of nomenclature here: previously we
  talked about seasonal-trend decompositions. And the fitted level component
  from Holt-Winters actually provides what we called the trend component
  previously! Meanwhile, the fitted trend component from Holt-Winters does not
  have a correspondence to anything we talked about previously. It reflects
  ``where the time series is heading''    

\item Figure \ref{fig:decomposition} shows an example on the holiday travel
  data. Both the additive and multiplicative methods return fairly similar
  component estimates. The seasonal pattern also appears to be unchanging over 
  time, which is a consequence of the fact that the estimate of $\gamma$ in both
  models is tiny (around 0.0001 in both models, as can be seen in the R notebook)

\begin{figure}[p]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{fig/decomposition-1.pdf}
\caption{Decomposition of the Australian holiday travel data (from HA) from the
  Holt-Winters method in additive and multiplication forms.}    
\label{fig:decomposition}
\end{figure}
\end{itemize}

\section{ETS models}

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Exponential smoothing with trend and seasonality} (ETS) models are a
  class that includes everything we've seen thus far: simple exponential
  smoothing, Holt's linear trend method, Holt-Winters method with additive or
  multiplicative seasonality, and all of their damped trend versions  

\item In fact, ETS includes more: we can also change the model to accomodate a  
  \emph{multiplicative error} component (rather than an additive error
  component, as was previously introduced). This will be made more precise when
  we talk about the state space representation, below 

\item (While mathematically possible, HA do not recommend allowing for a
  multiplicative trend, since they say that it can often behave poorly in
  practice) 

\item Thus we an ETS model is written ETS($x,y,z$), where 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $x \in \{ \text{A}, \text{M} \}$
  \item $y \in \{ \text{N}, \text{A}, \text{Ad} \}$
  \item $z \in \{ \text{N}, \text{A}, \text{M} \}$
  \end{itemize}
  here N stands for ``none'' (no trend component or no seasonality component), A
  stands for ``additive'', Ad stands for ``additive-damped'', and M stands for
  multiplicative

\item So to be clear:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item ETS(A,N,N) is simple exponential smoothing
  \item ETS(A,A,N) is Holt's linear trend method
  \item ETS(A,Ad,N) is the damped linear trend method
  \item ETS(A,A,A) is Holt-Winters with additive seasonality
  \item ETS(A,A,M) is Holt-Winters with multiplicative seasonality
  \end{itemize}

\item Note: HA do not recommend combining additive errors with multiplicative
  seasonality, saying that this can lead to numerical instability when
  estimating parameters. Thus they say that ETS(A,*,M) should generally be
  ditched in favor of ETS(M,*,M)   
\end{itemize}

\subsection{State space representation}

\begin{itemize}
\item A useful way to represent (and think about) ETS models is what is called
  a \emph{state space} formulation. This gives equivalent point forecasts 
  \smash{$\hat{x}_{t+h | t}$}, but moreover provides a probabilistic framework 
  for ETS models, which informs us how to carry out maximum likelihood and
  compute prediction intervals

\item We'll start by writing ETS(A,N,N) or SES \eqref{eq:ses_comp} in state
  space form. This is:   
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:ann_ss}
  \begin{aligned}
  x_t &= \ell_{t-1} + \epsilon_t \\
  \ell_t &= \ell_{t-1} + \alpha \epsilon_t
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  The first equation is typically called the observation (or measurement)
  equation, and the second is called the state equation
  
\item In \eqref{eq:ann_ss}, and all state space formulations henceforth, each
  error $\epsilon_t$ is i.i.d.\ taken to be $N(0, \sigma^2)$. Thus the joint
  distribution of the observations $x_1,\dots,x_t$ is fully specified by
  \eqref{eq:ann_ss} and we can do maximum likelihood in order to estimate the
  unknown parameters: here, $\alpha$ and $\ell_0$ 

\item To see \eqref{eq:ann_ss} is equivalent to \eqref{eq:ses_comp}, we have to
  understand how point forecasts are generated. This will explained in more
  detail later, but it is really the exact same story as in ARIMA: we replace
  past errors by their residuals, and future errors by zero. Thus in
  \eqref{eq:ann_ss}, the state equation at time $t$ becomes    
  \[
  \ell_t = \ell_{t-1} + \alpha (x_t - \ell_{t-1})
  \]
  and the observation equation at time $t+1$ gives us the forecast:
  \[
  \hat{x}_{t+1 | t} = \ell_t + 0
  \]
  Clearly, the last two equations together recreate SES as defined in
  \eqref{eq:ses_comp}    

\item As another example, ETS(A,A,N) or Holt's linear trend \eqref{eq:holt} in 
  state space form is: 
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:aan_ss}
  \begin{aligned}
  x_t &= \ell_{t-1} + b_{t-1} + \epsilon_t \\
  \ell_t &= \ell_{t-1} + b_{t-1} + \alpha \epsilon_t \\
  b_t &= b_{t-1} + \beta \epsilon_t
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  For convenience, we have redefined the product $\alpha \beta$ (with $\beta$ as
  originally defined in \eqref{eq:holt}) as simply $\beta$ in \eqref{eq:aan_ss},
  which is commonly done in the literature  

\item As another example, ETS(M,A,N) in state space form is: 
  \begin{equation}
  \label{eq:man_ss}
  \begin{aligned}
  x_t &= (\ell_{t-1} + b_{t-1})(1 + \epsilon_t) \\
  \ell_t &= (\ell_{t-1} + b_{t-1})(1 + \alpha \epsilon_t) \\
  b_t &= b_{t-1} + \beta (\ell_{t-1} + b_{t-1}) \epsilon_t 
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation}
  Note that the contribution of errors in \eqref{eq:man_ss} are multiplicative 

\item To read the details of the other state space representations, see Chapter 
  8.5 of HA
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Estimation and selection}

\begin{itemize}
\item On estimation and selection in ETS, we will say even less than we did with
  ARIMA, but the story is largely the same ...

\item To estimate model parameters
  ($\alpha,\beta,\phi,\gamma,\ell_0,b_0,s_0,s_{-1},\dots$, or some subset
  thereof), we use the state space representation, form the
  likelihood---assuming normal errors in the state space representation, and
  then maximize the likelihood. We could also estimate parameters by minimizing
  least squares, but that is not equivalent for ETS models in general 

\item In R, the \verb|ETS()| function in the \verb|fable| package allows us to
  specify and fit any model in the ETS family

\item Selecting a particular ETS model (additive or multiplicative errors?
  presence of trend? damped trend? seasonality? etc.?) is pretty difficult, in
  one sense, just like order selection in ARIMA is difficult. Here, we refer to
  difficulty in the sense of model identification: supposing there were one true
  data generating model among the ETS state space family, it would be hard to
  identify it reliably 

\item There are automated algorithms to select an ETS model, and these are
  implemented in \verb|ETS()|, but you have to be careful using them. They can
  sometimes identify some aspects well (like the period, if seasonality is
  obvious), but can also introduce a lot of variance 

\item We will adopt our same perspective with ARIMA, and forecasting models in
  general: \emph{an ETS model is useful if it predicts well}, and will appeal to
  time series CV to help us decide what to use 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Forecasting}

\begin{itemize}
\item Point forecasts with ETS are defined directly with their original
  formulations: \eqref{eq:ses_comp}, \eqref{eq:holt}, \eqref{eq:damped}, 
  \eqref{eq:holt_winters}, etc.

\item The state space representation provides an equivalent view, and also
  allows us to produce prediction intervals. The general approach to forecasting
  is analogous to that in ARIMA

\item Obtaining the forecast \smash{$\hat{x}_{t+h | t}$} from an ETS model can
  be done by iterating the following steps:  

\begin{enumerate}
\item Start with the ETS state space representation and rewrite the equation by
  replacing $t$ with $t+h$

\item Replace future observations ($x_{t+k}$, $k \geq 1$) with their forecasts,
  future errors ($w_{t+k}$, $k \geq 1$) with zero, and past errors ($w_{t-k}$,
  $k \geq 0$) with their ETS residuals   
\end{enumerate}

\item Obtaining prediction intervals can be done by first computing an estimate
  \smash{$\hat\sigma^2_h$} of the variance of the ``$h$-step ahead forecast
  distribution'' from ETS (in quotes because we have not precisely defined this,
  but see Section 8.7 in HA for details and for precise formulae). Then we could
  use  
  \[
  N\big( \hat{x}_{t+h | t}, \hat\sigma^2_h \big)
  \]
  as our model for the $h$-step ahead forecast distribution at time $t$, and
  compute prediction intervals accordingly

\item We could also simulate future forecast paths via the bootstrap, as
  implemented in the \verb|fable| package's \verb|forecast()| function when 
  \verb|bootstrap = TRUE|. The idea is just as before (as in ARIMA): in step 2,
  instead of replacing future errors ($w_{t+k}$, $k \geq 0$) by zero, we replace
  them by a bootstrap draw (i.e., a uniform sample with replacement) from the
  empirical distribution of past residuals. Then, post simulation, we read off
  sample quantiles at $t+h$ for a prediction interval     

\item Neither of the above methods (nor any traditional methods) actually
  guarantee coverage in practice. We will need to run calibration methods on
  top if we want long-run coverage guarantees in general, which we'll cover in
  the next (and final) lecture 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ARIMA versus ETS}
\begin{itemize}
\item ARIMA and ETS models bear interesting connections, and it is worth
  discussing their similarities and differences

\item Recall that there are 18 ETS models in total: 2 choices for the errors (A,
  M) $\times$ 3 choices for trend (N, A, Ad) $\times$ 3 choices for seasonality

\item Interesting fact: \emph{the 6 fully additive ETS models: ETS(A,N,N), 
    ETS(A,A,N), ETS(A,N,A), ETS(A,A,A), ETS(A,Ad,N), and ETS(A,Ad,A), are each  
    special cases of ARIMA models}

\item We showed at the end of the last lecture that ARIMA(0,1,1) was actually
  the same as SES. Similar proofs are possible for the other fully additive ETS
  models. An important note: in each case here, the I component in the
  equivalent ARIMA model is nontrivial ($d \not= 0$), which means that all ETS 
  models are nonstationary  

\item Meanwhile, each of the other 12 ETS models with a multiplicative component  
  is not a special case of ARIMA 

\item And lastly, some ARIMA models are stationary: precisely, ARMA models ($d =
  0$), whereas all ETS models are nonstationary, as just noted above

\item This is all nicely summarized by Figure \ref{fig:arima_ets} which is taken
  from Chapter 9.10 of HA

\item Conceptually, ARIMA and ETS are born out of different lines of motivation:
  ARIMA stems from modeling auto-correlations, in either the process itself (AR) 
  or the errors (MA), whereas ETS stems from a modeling components of the time
  series (level, trend, seasonal)

\item Both classes can lead to useful forecasters, and we will typically fit one
  or more models from each class and use time series CV to compare
